# COMP-6771-Image-Processing
This course was mainly about digital image fundamentals including:
1. image transforms (Fourier, Haar, wavelet), 
2. image enhancement (histogram processing, spatial filtering, high- and low-pass filtering), image restoration, 
3. image compression (elements of information theory, image compression models, error-free compression, lossy compression), 
4. image segmentation (line detection, Hough transform, edge detection and linking, thresholding, region splitting and merging), 
5. representation and description (chain codes, signatures, skeletons, shape descriptors, moments, texture).
